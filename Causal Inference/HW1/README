This is the first assignment. In the first part we were required to do some basic stuff. In the second part the tubingen dataset(which is not here) 
is given and in each task we should have determine whether or not the columns are independent based on using HSIC method for checking
the independency of residuals after non-linear regression. For non-linear regression, we have used spline method!
