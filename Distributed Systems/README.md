#### Distibuted Systems- Spring 2020
- The course was based on Nancy Lynch's book for the most part. From the first HW to the $4^{th}$ one, we implemented a chat box(PHW0), Leader election with LCR algorithm
(PHW1), Flooding alogorithm(PHW2), counting the population size(a simple population protocol) based on gossiping, and PAXOS algorithm.
- In the final part, the course was focused on Cloud Computing and HADOOP. We implemented a generalized page rank algorithm on Spark(PHW4)
